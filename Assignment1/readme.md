Executive Summary: In this assignment I had to setup github and lik it to my instructor. Then I learned how to use mysql along with the virtual machine. After that We used the northwind script and practiced making queries.
Assignment Outcomes: I open the script file by downloading it from the teachers notes and renaming it from northwind to mynamenorthwind. After this I opend the script through local in mysql. To run the script after open use the thunderbolt symbol. In the future I plan on reading the book first as the book was what ended up solving most of my issues. Some issues I ran into was how to use mysql as I have never done so before. I was able to read in the chapter to figure out to setup my queries how I wanted them. All in all though I would say this assignment was fairly easy. I am good at learning things on my own using teacher notes and book. Although I also like working together in and out of class with other students. I plan to allocate more time to make these assignments as they start to get harder as I am sure they will.
