1) For the first normal I identified that I wanted student names and classes to be a primary key. I also wanted to get single values in the data.
2)Second Normal I made sure there was no repeating rows. I also seperated classes and student Id tables from each other. I also seperated my major advisor table out from the rest.
3) Third Normal I made sure all my fields were dependent only on my primary keys of student.ID, class.ID, and MajorAdvisor.ID. I then tied arrows between the simularites in each table to make it easy to read.
