Query 1:  In this query I display company name, shipped date and freight for each customer order by using Join to join them and then use order by to sort by company name ascending.
Query 2: In this query I show the product name, unit price and quantity ordered for each detail item from the order_details table where the price is over 20 using where to find greater than 20 and order by to sort.
Query 3: In this query I show the product name, category name and supplier name for each product since this needed to use three tables I used natural join to mesh them together without needing to compare them to a same column like normal join.
Query 4:In this query I show company name, product name, ship date and quantity for all of the customer orders using natural joins and join to add some columns raw and others compared to other columns. Then I sorted at the end.
