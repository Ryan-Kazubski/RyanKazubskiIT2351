In task number 4 my goal was to provide supplier info and products they supply in a way that could be used effectively. I decided the first column should be country so that everything is region specific. Then I figured supplier would be next most important so I ordered by company name. My hope was to go from broad to specific left to right in my report. Thats why individual product names are last while region and companies are first. This report would be a good way to analyze companies and products you work with around the world in easily readable format.
Task 5 Conclusions: In conclusion there are 4 companies with no units in stock and no orders. I recomend looking into closing out these products or changing them completely. Secondly, there is one company with 6 units in stock and isn't discontinued. I believe we should discount the unit price to sell off the last 6 units and close out hat product as well as there seems to be no interest. On the other side there are 5 companies with less than 10 units in stock with a back log of orders. We should contact those companies and see what the hold up is or if there has been a malfunction somewhere in the communication process. Its not ok to keep orders waiting as we must br timely to increase reorder level interest. In my opinion the back ordered items should be pushed in the prioity of the company business while I get in contact with the proper resources to discuss closing the products with no interest and no stock.
