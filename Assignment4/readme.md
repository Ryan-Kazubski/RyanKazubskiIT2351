query 1: used the count, averag, and sum commands to calculate the right numbers.
query2: had to use count and max to get the max values and total unit price. I grouped by category than sorted by descending
query3: had to mess with sum group and with rollup to show total quantity purchased
query4: had to use a sub query to find average unit price and which ones were greater than that.
